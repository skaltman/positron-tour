**We’re excited to introduce [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/start.html),** a next-generation data science IDE that makes it easy to work in both R and Python.

Positron builds on our years of experience developing RStudio and is a fork of VS Code, designed specifically for data work. This means you get a modern coding interface with features tailored for data science, like a built-in data explorer, AI assistance, interpreter management, and more.

## Where to Get Positron

Download Positron for macOS, Windows, or Linux: [https://positron.posit.co/download.html](https://positron.posit.co/download.html).


## A Quick Tour

Now let’s take a closer look at some of the key features of Positron.

### Manage interpreters: Switch between R and Python versions

Positron supports multiple interpreter sessions across R and Python, allowing you to **switch between environments easily within a single workspace.** 

Positron shows the *active interpreter* in the upper-right corner (the interpreter picker) and highlights it in the Console. Switch between interpreters by clicking on the interpreter picker.

### Data Explorer: Visually inspect your data  

The **Data Explorer gives you a spreadsheet-style view of your data.** You can filter and sort tables, as well as view summary statistics for each column. 

This makes it easy to quickly inspect datasets, check for missing values, or preview the results of your transformations. 

To access the Data Explorer, click on the spreadsheet icon next to the dataset in the Variables pane.

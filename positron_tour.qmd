**We’re excited to introduce [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/start.html),** a next-generation data science IDE that makes it easy to work in both R and Python.

Positron builds on our years of experience developing RStudio and is a fork of VS Code, designed specifically for data work. This means you get a modern coding interface with features tailored for data science, like a built-in data explorer, AI assistance, interpreter management, and more.

## Where to Get Positron

You can download the Positron for macOS, Windows, or Linux at: [https://positron.posit.co/download.html](https://positron.posit.co/download.html).


## A Quick Tour

Now let’s take a closer look at some of the key features of Positron.

### Interpreters

Positron supports multiple interpreter sessions across R and Python, allowing you to switch between environments easily within a single workspace. 

Positron shows the **active interpreter** in the upper-right corner, as well as highlights it in the Console. 

You can see which interpreter is active in the interpreter picker in the upper-right corner. Switch between interpreters by clicking on the interpreter picker.

### Data Explorer

The Data Explorer gives you a spreadsheet-style view of your data. You can filter and sort tables, as well as view summary statistics for each column. 

This makes it easy to quickly inspect datasets, check for missing values, or preview the results of your transformations. 

To access the Data Explorer, click on the spreadsheet icon next to the dataset in the Variables pane.

## Connections Pane

The Connections Pane allows you to explore database connections created within your R or Python sessions. Once you've opened a connection, you can use the Connections Pane to explore the database schema.

## Positron Assistant

Positron Assistant is an AI tools that provides LLM integration within Positron. Positron Assistant can generate code, help you debug, and provide suggestions for next steps in your projects. 

Note that Positron Assistant is currently a **preview** feature. Learn more, including how to setup Positron Assistant, [here](https://positron.posit.co/assistant.html).

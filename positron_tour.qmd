**We’re excited to introduce [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/start.html),** a next-generation data science IDE that makes it easy to work in both R and Python.

Positron builds on our years of experience developing RStudio and is a fork of VS Code, designed specifically for data work. This means you get a modern coding interface with features tailored for data science, like a built-in data explorer, AI assistance, interpreter management, and more.

## Download Positron

Download Positron for macOS, Windows, or Linux: [https://positron.posit.co/download.html](https://positron.posit.co/download.html).

## Layout

First, let's take a look at the general layout of Positron.

Positron's core layout components include:

* **Activity Bar**: Access the Explorer, Search, Source Control, Extensions, and other views.
* **Primary Side Bar**: Shows different views depending on what you have chosen in the Activity Bar. When the Explorer is chosen, the Primary Side Bar provides a file explorer. 
* **Editor**: Where you write your code. 
* **Panel**: Contains the Console and Terminal. 
* **Secondary Side Bar**: Explore variables, view plots, access documentation, and more.  

## A Quick Tour

Now, let’s take a quick look at some of Positron’s key features.

### Manage interpreters: Switch between R and Python versions

Positron supports multiple interpreter sessions across R and Python, allowing you to **switch between environments easily within a single workspace.** 

Positron shows the *active interpreter* in the upper-right corner (the interpreter picker) and highlights it in the Console. Switch between interpreters by clicking on the interpreter picker.

### Data Explorer: Visually inspect your data  

The **Data Explorer gives you a spreadsheet-style view of your data.** You can filter and sort tables, as well as view summary statistics for each column. 

This makes it easy to quickly inspect datasets, check for missing values, or preview the results of your transformations. 

To access the Data Explorer, click on the spreadsheet icon next to the dataset in the Variables pane.

### Connections Pane: Explore database connections

The Connections Pane allows you to **explore database connections created within your R or Python sessions.** Once you've opened a connection, you can use the Connections Pane to explore the database schema.
